    <h6 class="animated fadeInRight wow" data-wow-delay=".3s">Paper Towns is the third young adult novel written by John Green. It was published on October 16, 2008 by Dutton Books. The novel explores the coming of age and search of the protagonist, Quentin "Q" Jacobsen, for Margo Roth Spiegelman, his neighbour and childhood love interest. Along his search, Quentin and his friends, Ben, Radar, and Lacey, discover more about the "real" Margo. Around the release of the film adaptation, the novel was subjected to critical reviews. It has even been challenged in a school district for its sexual content. John Green gained inspiration for this book, through his experience and knowledge of "paper towns", during a road trip through South Dakota.</h6>

    

    <h3 class="animated fadeInRight wow" data-wow-delay=".3s"><font face="Georgia" color="light-blue darken-4">Critical reception:</font></h3>
    <p class="animated fadeInRight wow" data-wow-delay=".3s"><justify>Paper Towns received mostly positive reviews. Publishers Weekly said that "the title, which refers to unbuilt subdivisions and copyright trap towns that appear on maps but don't exist, unintentionally underscores the novel's weakness: both milquetoast Q and self-absorbed Margo are types, not fully dimensional characters." They also commented that the novel is "another teen pleasing read". Meanwhile, Kirkus Reviews praised the novel as "a winning combination." Similarly, School Library Journal said that "Q is a great social outcast main character who sometimes thinks a little too much, but is completely relatable. Though we only really see Margo for the first third of the book, the clues really create her character and give us the feeling she's a complex person. Finding out who Margo is through the things she left behind was a really great way to develop her character."

    Furthermore, Rebecca Swain of Orlando Sentinel stated: "Paper Towns has convinced me that jaded adult readers need to start raiding the Teen's section at the bookstore. Green, who grew up in Orlando and uses the city as a backdrop for the story, taps into the cadence of teenage life with sharp and funny writing, but transcends age with deeper insights." Similarly, Chelsey G.H. Philpot, editorial assistant of The Horn Book Guide, commented that "the end breaks your heart, and yet it feels right." Meanwhile, Rollie Welch called Paper Towns "Green's best work" up to that point. Critics, such as Michael Cart, praise John Green for his symbolism and ability to synthesize imagination and reality: "Green ponders the interconnectedness of imagination and perception, of mirrors and windows, of illusion and reality." Nevertheless, there has been some criticism and objection towards the text. Robert Corwin of Arizona State University argues that "some readers may find the author's use of language and sexual content objectionable."

    A number of reviewers noted the novel's similarity to Gregory Galloway's 2005 novel As Simple As Snow. The Cleveland Plain Dealer stated, “Readers will find that the structure and central mystery of "Paper Tow 0 +ns" echo Green's debut, Looking for Alaska, and Gregory Galloway's 2005 novel, "As Simple as Snow," and Kirkus Reviews wrote that Green's novel was “reminiscent" of Galloway's novel.</justify></p>
