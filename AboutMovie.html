    <h6 class="animated fadeInRight wow" data-wow-delay=".3s"><justify>In Orlando, Florida, Quentin "Q" Jacobsen lives next door to Margo Roth Spiegelman, his childhood friend from whom he has since drifted, but still has feelings for. One night, when she climbs through his window and summons him on an all-night road trip of revenge, he cannot help but follow her lead. The next day, however, Margo does not come to school, and after a few days some consider her missing, others just conclude she left to an undisclosed location. Q soon learns that Margo left clues about where she would be going, and concludes she is in a particular paper town in New York state. Q goes there by car with his best friends Ben and Radar, Radar's girlfriend Angela, and one of Margo's best friends, Lacey. They are in a hurry, because they want to be back in time for the prom. On the way Ben gets very happy about the fact that afterwards Lacey will go to the prom with him. Margo does not show up at the assumed spot. Q stays, while the others return with the car. He finds her, but she is not in love with him. She left the clues just to let him know she is safe, not to invite him to follow her. Q returns by bus and Margo stays.</justify></h6>

    <h3 class="animated fadeInRight wow" data-wow-delay=".3s"><font face="Georgia" color="light-blue darken-4">Reception:</font></h3>
    <p class="animated fadeInRight wow" data-wow-delay=".3s"><justify>As of September 6, 2015, Paper Towns has grossed $31.5 million in North America and $50.4 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $81.9 million, against a budget of $12 million.

    In the United States and Canada, Paper Towns opened in 3,031 theaters on July 24, 2015, alongside two other films, Pixels and Southpaw. Box office pundits projected the film to earn around $20 million in its opening weekend, facing direct competition with Pixels and the holdovers of Ant-Man and Minions. Box office analysts also noted that it could have easily overperformed and had a higher debut, if teen girls – which are its primary target – would have embraced the film and word-of-mouth had gone viral. Paper Towns made $2 million from its Thursday night showings, which began at 9 p.m. at 2,500 theaters; 500 of the screens were preceded by a live-streaming event.It then earned $6.3 million on its opening day from 3,301 theaters. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $12.5 million and finished 6th at the box office, falling short of industry projections and earning much less than the $48 million opening weekend gross of The Fault in Our Stars, a 2014 adaption of John Green's novel of the same name.

    It had a major worldwide release on July 24, 2015, in 34 markets grossing $7.9 million from 3,905 screens in 39 markets. It opened in Brazil on July 10, 2015 – the first country to release the film – and earned $2.38 million in its opening weekend, from 630 screens, debuting at third place at the Brazilian box office, behind Minions and Terminator: Genisys. However, in terms of admissions, it was second behind the former film. It had notable openings in Mexico ($1.54 million) and in Australia ($1.53 million). It was released in 18 additional countries in late July and early August, including Germany, Belgium and Netherlands.</justify></p>
