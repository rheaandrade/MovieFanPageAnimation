    <p class="animated fadeInRight wow" data-wow-delay=".3s"><justify>The protagonist and narrator of the story. He has had a crush on his neighbor, Margo, since they were kids. Throughout their childhood and adolescent years, his crush on Margo develops. In the book, Quentin realizes his love for Margo, particularly after her disappearance. He tracks clues that he thinks Margo has left behind for him to help him find her. Quentin soon becomes obsessed with finding these clues and recruits his friends to help him find Margo. His desire to find Margo results in him neglecting school and his friends, which Radar rebukes him for. His obsession, in turn, causes him to possess this fantastical and essentially perfect image of Margo. Towards the end of the novel, he discovers that his image and expectations of her were unreal.</justify></p>
